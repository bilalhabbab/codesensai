CodeSensai is a LeetCode-style practice platform: solve coding problems under a timer, pick from Easy / Medium / Hard, and get instant AI feedback on each submission.

âœ¨ Core features
	â€¢	3 difficulty tiers (Easy, Medium, Hard)
	â€¢	Timed sessions (per-problem countdown; auto-submit on expiry)
	â€¢	AI feedback (hints, failure explanations, incremental guidance)
	â€¢	Submission history (verdicts, runtime, attempts)
	â€¢	Auth & profiles (track progress; admin can add/edit problems)

ðŸ›  Tech (expected)
	â€¢	TypeScript across the stack
	â€¢	Backend: Node.js (Express/Fastify), Postgres (problems, users, submissions), Redis + queue (job runs), Docker-isolated runners
	â€¢	AI: OpenAI/Anthropic for feedback generation
	â€¢	Frontend: React + code editor (Monaco), router, simple state store
